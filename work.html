                A social media web application is an online platform designed to connect individuals and 
                facilitate the sharing of user-generated content. Users create personal profiles, establish connections with others through friend or follow features, 
                and share diverse content, including text updates, photos, and videos. The central news feed or timeline displays a chronological stream of content from connections,
                 while interactive features such as likes, comments, and shares foster engagement. Privacy settings allow users to control the visibility of their content, and additional features like groups, pages, 
                 and messaging contribute to a dynamic and interactive online community. With mobile accessibility and search functionality, social media web applications have become integral to modern communication and self-expression.
