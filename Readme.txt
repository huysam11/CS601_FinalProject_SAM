## Updates

### 1. Added Pages

- Created two additional pages: [Page 1](page1.html) and [Page 2](page2.html).

### 2. CSS Structure

- Introduced a modular CSS approach with a total of 8 CSS files.
  - **CSS Base (`base.css`):**
    - Shared styles for all pages.
    - Defines a transition effect for background color and text color changes.
  - **Page-Specific CSS:**
    - Each page has its specific CSS file (e.g., `home.css`, `about.css`).
    - Customize styles for each page individually.

### 3. Responsive Design

- Implemented responsiveness by adjusting text color and background color based on screen size breakpoints (700, 1200, and 1920).
- At a screen size of 1200, the page will display content in a column layout.

### Next Steps

1. **Upcoming Features:**
   - Plan to add animations for a more dynamic user experience.

2. **Animation Guidelines:**
   - Consider incorporating fade-in animations using CSS for a smooth transition.
   - Customize animation properties and styles to align with the overall design.
