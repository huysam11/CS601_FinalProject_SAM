<h1>CS 601 Final Project - Portfolio Website</h1>
This repository is my portfolio website 
<h1>Above and Beyond</h1>
<h2>ES 6 Features</h2>
I implemented various ES6 features in my code, including Arrow functions, template literals, let and const declarations, the fetch API, object destructuring, 'for each' array method, and promises.
<h2>Database Functionality</h2>
To enhance data management, I created a JSON file containing my table data and utilized the fetch API to retrieve and display the data dynamically.
<h2>CSS FLEXBOX</h2>
I employed CSS Flexbox throughout the website, ensuring responsiveness across three screen sizes: window, tablet, and mobile views.
<h1>Checklists</h1>
<ol>
<li>I created seven pages, ensuring each one is responsive to different screen sizes.</li>
<li>I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the core development of my website.</li>
<li> For Vue.js functionality, I incorporated the createApp function, template syntax, data properties, methods, data binding, event handling, and the mounting of the app.</li>
<li>I employed DOM manipulation to interact with multiple elements in my web pages.
</li>
<li>The design is consistent across all pages for a cohesive user experience.
</li>
<li>I implemented a rainbow scroll bar using JavaScript for added visual appeal.
</li>
<li>I incorporated animations for the titles on each page to enhance the overall presentation.
</li>
