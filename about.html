            <h3>My Career</h3>
            <p> I'm a results-driven software development professional with a strong educational foundation and a
                passion for continuous learning.
                My journey in the world of technology began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems
                from Georgia State University, where I cultivated a deep understanding of the fundamental principles
                of software development.
                Building on this, I pursued a Master's degree in Software Development from Boston University,
                further honing my skills and gaining valuable insights into the latest industry trends and practices
            </p>
            <p>With a proactive approach to problem-solving and a keen eye for detail, I am committed to delivering
                exceptional results in every task I undertake.
                My educational background, combined with my hands-on experience, has equipped me with a
                comprehensive understanding of various programming languages and frameworks, enabling me to adapt to
                diverse and challenging projects.
                I am dedicated to leveraging my expertise to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape
                of software development, and I am eager to take on new challenges and opportunities for professional
                growth.

            <h3>My favorite Hobby</h3>
            <p>I'm thrilled to share my love for the world of cinema with you. For me, watching movies isn't just a
                pastime;
                it's a journey that allows me to escape into different worlds, experience diverse emotions, and
                immerse myself in the art of storytelling.
                From heartwarming tales that leave me smiling for days to intense thrillers that keep me on the edge
                of my seat, every film I watch adds a unique hue to the canvas of my life.
                Through this platform, I aim to celebrate the magic of movies and inspire fellow cinephiles to
                explore the endless possibilities that unfold on the silver screen</p>
